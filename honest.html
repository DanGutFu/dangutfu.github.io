			<p>Non Monogamy! Open Relationships! Polyamory! Relationship Anarchy! How do the myths differ from the practical applications? How does it actually work in real life? Is there a Golden Path to 'polyamorous perfection', or is it a multilinear dance where we each get to decide what works for us as individuals?</p>
			<p>Whether honest non-monogamy is new to you, or you have years of experience, this workshop promises to offer fresh and insightful perspectives, and empower you with new tools to assist you in enjoying more fulfilling relationships!</p>
