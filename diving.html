			<p id="worktitle"><em>Diving into Desires<br/>with Mel Mariposa</em></p>
			<p>What do you want, and why is it so scary to ask for it?<br/>What clues do our desires give us about our needs?<br/>How do we sabotage our desires without even realising it, and how can we have more exciting and fulfilling relationships?</p>
			<p>In this high energy, interactive mini-workshop with relationship coach Mel Mariposa, we'll be playfully exploring these questions and learning techniques for building authentic, dynamic, empowering connections in our relationships.</p>
